Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project I was tasked with programming an item-tracker for a grocery store. The program needed to be able to analyze the text records that generate throughout the day. The records needed to list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. The ability to rearrange the produce section and to know how often items are purchased so a user focused layout can be created and displayed.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I managed my time well when completeing this project. I used my time well giving me the ability to produce clean code at industry standards.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could be enhanced with additional comments. I think I could use more detailed comments making my code easier to read.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Adding the addtional functionality for manipulating the data was challenging. I looked back at the lessons in zybooks to help find a solution to my issue. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The overall knowledge that was gained from this project will be helpful in the future. Parts of this program can be used for other projects in the future. This program can easily be used to manipulate other types of data sets with minor edits.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program can easily be adapted to manipulate other types of data sets with minor edits. I wrote clean code with industry standards in mind so it would be readable for others. I feel that the programs adaptability is also a result of its ability to be maintained. Since clean code was written future major updates should be avoid and minor updates can be applied to meet users requests or feedback.
